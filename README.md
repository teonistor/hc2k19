# Matrix Poker

The prototype for a game of Poker (Texas Hold'em) developed during Hack Cambridge 2019. The goal of this project has been to address the challenge proposed by Improbable: build a probabilistic game AI by leveraging a probabilistic programming language.

Improbable's own such language, Keanu, was used, and inspiration was taken from their starter example: https://github.com/improbable-research/keanu-starter

The game allows one human player to play against different combinations of random-action agents and probabilistic agents - although currently the latter don't give any impressive performance. These bots can also be set to play against each other.
